				<h3> What is this all about? </h3>
				<ul>
					<li> Connect your datasource (only MySQL for now) and draw charts!</li>
				</ul>
				<h3> What's the catch?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li> This is a proof of concept application and is more unstable than a drunken monkey on Speed.</li>
					<li> If your table names or column names contain spaces or funny characters, this will blow up. </li>
					<li> You can only plot bar charts, that too date and time columns are not supported.</li>
					<li> It's not been tested. Your database may blow up, your server may melt, your eyes may bleed, or ... you get the point.</li>
					<li> <i>Nothing</i> is coded defensively. Infact every line in the code has been carefully crafted to offend the delicate sensibilities of every developer who cares about code craftsmanship.</li>
					<li> If asked, I will publicly disavow having ever written this. </li>
				</ul>
				<h3> How do I get started? </h3>
				<ul>
					<li> Add a data source (click on the top right). </li>
					<li> Create a chart. That's it!</li>
				</ul>
